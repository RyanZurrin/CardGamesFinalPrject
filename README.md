# CardGamesFinalProject
Card game final project
This is our final project in Data Structures class. There is three of us in this class and we were each assigned a different card game to implement on our own and
and then we are to come together and make a single card game where a user can select what card came they want to play and then play it, and it has to allow the 
user to have the option to return to menu to pick a different game should they want to stop playing one game. We have been provided with the base cards data structure
by our professor so we are all working with the same deck of cards. From there we are to design our game in a way that makes it playable and fun, fulfilling the game
requirements and after this we will merge our ideas and designs into one finished and playable game.
