My idea is that we make classes for our idividual games and then call them in CardGames.cpp. 
I started to add my game so you guys can see what i mean.
Its just a template for now. My plan is to implement some input checking and a proper menu. 
You guys are welcome to do this if you get to it before me.
But a working game is more important than a menu.

Feel free to add to this file....
